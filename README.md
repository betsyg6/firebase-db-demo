# Firebase DB Demo

This project was created to show other developers how to use Firebase as a real time database with React. If you're curious about how a specific line works, you can check out the comments branch, where I made comments to walk through how the code works.

To run the code:

```
cd <directory you want to download to>

git clone https://github.com/betsyg6/firebase-db-demo.git

npm install

npm start

```
